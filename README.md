This project was created with Parcel. For familiarization and setting additional
features [refer to documentation](https://parceljs.org/).

## Preparing a new project

1. Make sure you have an LTS version of Node.js installed on your computer.
   [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/) if needed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Change the folder name from `parcel-project-template` to the name of your
   project.
4. Create a new empty GitHub repository.
5. Open the project in VSCode, launch the terminal and link the project to the
   GitHub repository
   [by instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#changing-a-remote-repositorys-url).
6. Install the project's dependencies in the terminal with the `npm install`
   command.
7. Start development mode by running the `npm start` command.
8. Go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser. This
   page will automatically reload after saving changes to the project files.

## Files and folders

- All stylesheet parshas should be in the `src/sass` folder and imported into
  the page stylesheets. For example, for `index.html` the style file is named
  `index.scss`.
- Add images to the `src/images` folder. The assembler optimizes them, but only
  when deploying the production version of the project. All this happens in the
  cloud so as not to burden your computer, as it can take a long time on weak
  machines.

## Deploy

To set up a project deployment, you need to perform a few additional steps to
set up your repository. Go to the `Settings` tab and in the `Actions` subsection
select the `General` item.

Scroll the page to the last section, in which make sure the options are selected
as in the following image and click `Save`. Without these settings, the build
will not have enough rights to automate the deployment process.

The production version of the project will be automatically built and deployed
to GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, every time the `main` branch is
updated. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request. To do
this, you need to edit the `homepage` field and the `build` script in the
`package.json` file, replacing `your_username` and `your_repo_name` with your
own, and submit the changes to GitHub.

```json
"homepage": "https://your_username.github.io/your_repo_name/",
"scripts": {
  "build": "parcel build src/*.html --public-url /your_repo_name/"
},
```

Next, you need to go to the settings of the GitHub repository (`Settings` >
`Pages`) and set the distribution of the production version of files from the
`/root` folder of the `gh-pages` branch, if this was not done automatically.
